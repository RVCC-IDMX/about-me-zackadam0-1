            <h2>How to embed static Google maps:</h2>

            <div>

                <p>A common requirement depending on your job position and tasks in the field of Web Development could very 
                    well be incorporating interactive and visually appealing maps. One of the most popular choices is Google 
                    Maps as it is one of the most popular tools utilized by many. More than 150 million people use Google Maps 
                    monthly. Another major point is that Google Maps are interactive by default. They can help potential customers 
                    locate a business more easily, help people find landmarks or navigate towns and cities more easily, and can 
                    even highlight walkable routes if you are not traveling by vehicle. </p>

                <p>Once you embed a Google Map in your site there are many things that can actually then be done. You can either embed
                     the code using Javascript or HTML, and you can even style it using CSS. It is important to make sure that the map 
                    contains responsive design especially for different screen sizes. There are actually multiple ways to embed the Map, 
                    the first being by obtaining an API key then creating the iFrame yourself, but Google actually makes it much easier than 
                    this. When you search for a location or area you can simply press the “share” button on the Google Maps page for that point 
                    of interest. This will open up a window that allows you to resize the frame itself, but also contains the HTML iFrame code 
                    itself that you can just copy and integrate into your own HTML. It is possible to style the map differently as well; you can 
                    embed a satellite map, a standard Google map, or a street view map. </p>

                <p>It would be more ideal to consider using media queries or percentage values in your responsive design for the map to make sure 
                    it displays optimally across various screen sizes. In this era we currently have many diverse screen sizes and aspect ratios 
                    that make it much more important to take these responsive factors into consideration when designing. Below is an example 
                    of a standard Google Maps iFrame embed of Raritan Valley Community College. As you can see the ability to interact with 
                    the map is naturally included by Google making these iFrame embeds that much more convenient. </p>
