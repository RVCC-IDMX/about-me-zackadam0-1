            <h2>An Excerpt From: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</h2>

            <div>

                <p>On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall 
                    window with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish 
                    the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning 
                    to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; 
                    someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; 
                    had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries 
                    which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in 
                    the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who was it 
                    brought him the coronet?</p>

                <p>It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however 
                    improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only
                     remained your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be 
                     accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was 
                     an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret--the more so as the secret was a disgraceful 
                     one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the 
                     coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.</p>

                <p>And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love 
                    and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of 
                    friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as 
                    being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the 
                    missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he 
                    was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.</p>
